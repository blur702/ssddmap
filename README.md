- Interactive legends for all visualization modes

### üé® Modern UI/UX
- Dark theme with smooth animations
- Responsive design for desktop and mobile
- Real-time loading indicators
- Intuitive navigation between states and districts

## Technical Architecture

### Backend (Node.js/Express)
- **server.js**: Main Express server with RESTful API endpoints
- KML to GeoJSON conversion using @mapbox/togeojson
- Efficient caching of district and county geometries
- Point-in-polygon detection using Turf.js

### Frontend (Vanilla JavaScript)
- **public/app.js**: Core application logic
- **public/styles.css**: Dark theme styling with CSS variables
- **public/index.html**: Application structure
- Leaflet.js for interactive mapping
- CartoDB dark tiles for base map

### Data Sources
- Congressional district boundaries: KML files for each district
- County boundaries: cb_2020_us_county_500k.kml from US Census
- Member information: Live XML feed from house.gov
- Geocoding: OpenStreetMap Nominatim API

## API Endpoints

- `GET /api/state/:stateCode` - Get districts for a specific state
- `GET /api/district/:state/:district` - Get specific district GeoJSON and member info
- `GET /api/all-districts` - Get all districts as GeoJSON
- `GET /api/members` - Get all House member data
- `GET /api/geocode?address=` - Geocode an address
- `GET /api/find-location?lat=&lon=` - Find district and county for coordinates
- `GET /api/county-boundaries` - Get all county boundaries
- `GET /api/county-politics` - Get county political control analysis
- `GET /api/state-rep-counts` - Get representative counts by state
- `GET /api/bill-votes/:billId` - Get voting data for specific legislation
