  - Free tier: 250 lookups/month
  - Needed for ZIP+4 to congressional district mapping
- [ ] **Test API integrations with real credentials**
  - Verify USPS address standardization works
  - Verify Smarty district lookup returns correct data
  - Test error handling for invalid addresses
- [ ] **Consider alternative APIs**
  - Google Civic Information API (free tier available)
  - Geocod.io (2,500 free lookups/day)
  - Implement fallback mechanism between services

### ZIP+4 Database Population
- [ ] **Obtain ZIP+4 to congressional district mapping data**
  - Option 1: Purchase commercial database ($1,000-5,000/year)
  - Option 2: Use Smarty API to build cache over time
  - Option 3: Research alternative public data sources
  - Option 4: Contact USPS for special government access

  - Test batch processing with 100+ addresses
  - Verify CSV upload/download functionality
  - Test comparison accuracy between Census and ZIP+4
- [ ] **Performance testing**
  - Load test batch endpoint with 1000+ addresses
  - Test API rate limit handling
  - Optimize database queries for speed
- [ ] **Edge case testing**
  - PO Boxes and non-standard addresses
  - Military addresses (APO/FPO)
  - New construction without ZIP+4
  - Address parsing variations

## Current State Summary

- ‚úÖ Basic district visualization working
- ‚úÖ County overlay with political analysis
- ‚úÖ Address search with geocoding
- ‚úÖ Basic legislation tracking (H.R. 1)
- ‚úÖ FIPS code display
- ‚úÖ State representation visualization
- ‚úÖ Dark theme UI
- ‚úÖ GitHub repository set up
- ‚úÖ ZIP+4 integration structure implemented
- ‚úÖ **Streamlined district selection UI** with dropdown under "District Information"
- ‚úÖ **Party icons in dropdown** (üêò Republican, ü´è Democrat, ‚íæ Independent, ‚Ä¢ Vacant)
- ‚úÖ **Removed summary list** for cleaner interface
- ‚ö†Ô∏è ZIP+4 features require API configuration
- ‚ö†Ô∏è ZIP+4 database needs population with real data
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Batch processing needs real-world testing

The application is functional but the ZIP+4 features require API credentials and data to be fully operational.
