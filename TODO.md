## Current State Summary

- ‚úÖ Basic district visualization working
- ‚úÖ County overlay with political analysis
- ‚úÖ Address search with geocoding
- ‚úÖ Basic legislation tracking (H.R. 1)
- ‚úÖ FIPS code display
- ‚úÖ State representation visualization
- ‚úÖ Dark theme UI
- ‚úÖ GitHub repository set up

The application is functional but has room for significant enhancement in terms of features, performance, and user experience.
