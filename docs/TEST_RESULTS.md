# ZIP+4 Integration Test Results

## Current Status: PARTIALLY TESTED

### ‚úÖ Completed Implementation:
1. **Frontend UI Components**
   - Radio buttons for method selection (Geographic/ZIP+4/Compare Both)
   - Batch processing modal with textarea and CSV upload
   - Progress bar for batch processing
   - Comparison results display

2. **Backend Services**
   - AddressService with USPS and Smarty API integration
   - DatabaseService with SQLite for local ZIP+4 storage
   - Batch processing endpoint
   - CSV download endpoint

3. **Error Handling**
   - Proper error messages when API keys are missing
   - Database error handling
   - Frontend validation

### ‚ùå Not Yet Tested:
1. **API Integration**
   - USPS API calls (requires USPS_USER_ID)
   - Smarty API calls (requires SMARTY_AUTH_ID and SMARTY_AUTH_TOKEN)
   - Actual ZIP+4 to district mapping

2. **Database Operations**
   - Database table creation
   - ZIP+4 data population
   - Batch result storage

3. **Frontend Functionality**
   - Modal open/close behavior
   - CSV file parsing
   - Progress tracking during batch processing
   - Download functionality

4. **End-to-End Workflows**
   - Single address lookup with ZIP+4
   - Comparison between Census and ZIP+4 methods
   - Batch processing of multiple addresses
   - CSV export and import

### üîß Issues Found:
1. **Database Initialization**: Tables are created on first run but there's an error on initial lookup
2. **API Configuration**: Need environment variables for external services
3. **No Test Data**: Local database has no ZIP+4 mappings

### üìã Next Steps for Full Testing:
1. Set up API credentials:
   ```bash
   export USPS_USER_ID="your_usps_id"
   export SMARTY_AUTH_ID="your_smarty_id"
   export SMARTY_AUTH_TOKEN="your_smarty_token"
   ```

2. Populate test data in the database:
   ```javascript
   // Example ZIP+4 mapping
   await db.insertMapping({
       zip5: '20500',
       plus4_low: '0001',
       plus4_high: '0010',
       state_code: 'DC',
       district_number: '00',
       county_fips: '11001'
   });
   ```

3. Test with real addresses through the UI
4. Verify batch processing with multiple addresses
5. Test CSV upload/download functionality

### üö® Critical Requirements for Production:
1. **API Keys**: Must obtain and configure USPS and Smarty API credentials
2. **ZIP+4 Data**: Need to populate the local database with ZIP+4 to district mappings
3. **Testing**: Comprehensive testing with real addresses
4. **Performance**: Test with large batches (100+ addresses)
5. **Error Recovery**: Test network failures and API limits
