# Playwright Test Report for SSDD Map Application

## Test Setup
- **URL**: https://kevinalthaus.com/ssddmap/
- **Test Framework**: Playwright v1.54.1
- **Test Date**: 2025-07-12
- **Browsers Tested**: Chromium

## Summary
The SSDD Map application is largely functional but has some JavaScript errors that need attention. The map loads successfully and most UI elements are present and working.

## Test Results

### ✅ Successful Components
1. **Map Loading**
   - Leaflet map container loads successfully
   - Leaflet library v1.9.4 is properly initialized
   - Map tiles load correctly (48 tiles loaded during test)

2. **UI Elements Present**
   - Toolbar: ✓ Visible
   - App Title: ✓ Visible
   - Address Input: ✓ Visible
   - Search Button: ✓ Visible
   - State Selector: ✓ Visible (56 states loaded)
   - Map Style Selector: ✓ Visible
   - View USA Button: ✓ Visible
   - Data Management Button: ✓ Visible
   - Config Button: ✓ Visible
   - Info Sidebar: ✓ Visible
   - Party Legend: ✓ Visible

3. **Basic Functionality**
   - State selector works (able to select states)
   - Map style selector works (can switch between styles)

### ❌ Issues Found

1. **JavaScript Errors**
   - **Fixed**: Syntax error with unexpected token '}' at line 1437
   - **Fixed**: Syntax error with unexpected token ')' at line 2044
   - **Current Error**: `Cannot read properties of null (reading 'addEventListener')` at line 2087
     - This error prevents some functionality from loading

2. **Missing UI Elements**
   - Auto-suggest Toggle: Not visible
   - Rep View Toggle: Not visible
   - These elements are likely not rendering due to the JavaScript error

3. **Loading Overlay Issue**
   - The loading overlay sometimes blocks interaction with UI elements
   - This prevented testing of the configuration modal

4. **Minor Issues**
   - Missing favicon.ico (404 error) - cosmetic issue, not critical

## Test Files Created

1. **Test Specifications**:
   - `/tests/basic-app-load.spec.js` - Basic application load tests
   - `/tests/js-error-debug.spec.js` - JavaScript error debugging
   - `/tests/comprehensive-test.spec.js` - Comprehensive functionality tests

2. **Configuration**:
   - `playwright.config.js` - Playwright configuration with multiple browser support
   - `package.json` - Updated with test scripts

3. **Test Scripts**:
   - `run-tests.sh` - Run all tests
   - `run-single-test.sh` - Run a single test
   - `run-debug-test.sh` - Run debug test
   - `run-comprehensive-test.sh` - Run comprehensive test

## Recommendations

1. **Fix JavaScript Error**: Investigate line 2087 in app.js where an event listener is being added to a null element. This is likely causing the toggle switches to not render.

2. **Add Error Handling**: Add null checks before adding event listeners to prevent runtime errors.

3. **Loading Overlay**: Review the loading overlay logic to ensure it properly hides after page load.

4. **Continuous Testing**: Run these tests regularly during development to catch issues early.

## How to Run Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests with UI mode
npm run test:ui

# Run tests in debug mode
npm run test:debug

# View test report
npm run test:report
```

## Next Steps

1. Fix the remaining JavaScript error at line 2087
2. Ensure all UI elements render properly
3. Add more specific tests for:
   - Address search functionality
   - District selection and display
   - API integration tests
   - Mobile responsiveness
   - Cross-browser compatibility
